## Project Summary
Project Title: Macro Tracker

Our website will be a platform that tracks UIUC studentsâ€™ macros throughout the day. Typically, when trying to track caloric intake, it can be difficult to find nutrition information specific to the restaurants in your area. It is notably hard for college students who live on campus and eat out often at campus specific go-to restaurants. For this reason, we are building a UIUC campus specific platform that allows students to easily access, store, update, and track their food intake. 

Our platform will provide a dashboard display to easily manage your macros, including carb, fat, and protein content in each meal eaten throughout the day. The database will also keep track of user information such that each student will be able view their personal health profile and goals over time. The app will provide statistics and insights on their current health, as well as built-in recommendations of restaurants/food choices that help them reach their personalized goals.
